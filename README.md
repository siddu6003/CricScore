Since this is a realtime app we used to store firebase as our database and to get the
live scores of the ongoing matches we used an API called cric API .
News : This feature allows the user to read a few articles published in the last 24
hours.Currently this is not supported by any API but the news can be modified through
firebase.
Schedule : This feature allows the user to check the schedule of the ongoing
season.All the match details were already stored in the strings.xml file inside the app so
no need for any database.
Points Table : Gives Information about the points table of the ongoing season.Data
should be updated through firebase.
Teams : Users get information about the players and the franchise here.
Live Score : Most Important Feature of the app.Here we get a live scorecard.
Stas : This gives information about stats related to the current season and overall
We can also use firebase cloud messaging to send notifications to the users.
